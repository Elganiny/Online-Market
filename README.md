## Online-Market

#Description

        This program is a simple console-based ordering system for a restaurant.
        It allows the user to select items from a pre-defined menu, calculates the
        total cost of their order, and prints out a receipt. The program prompts
        the user to enter their name, address, and phone number at the beginning.
        If the delivery address is not in "Mansoura", there is a delivery fee of
        $5. If the user orders more than five items, there is a 20% discount on
        the total order price.
